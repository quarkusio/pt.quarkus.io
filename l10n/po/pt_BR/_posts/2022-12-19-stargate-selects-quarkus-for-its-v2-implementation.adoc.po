msgid "https://stargate.io[Stargate^], created in 2020, is a data API gateway that transforms https://cassandra.apache.org[Apache Cassandra^], an Open Source NoSQL database, into a JSON Document database. Stargate exposes Cassandra through a broad range of APIs, including JSON, https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/cql[CQL^], https://graphql.org[GraphQL^], REST, and https://grpc.io[gRPC^], bringing modular, service-oriented, and cloud native architectures into the Cassandra ecosystem in a non-invasive way."

Stargate allows applications to interact with Cassandra in a _driverless_ fashion, making it consumable by almost any kind of application on any technology stack. Stargate supports Cassandra’s traditional CQL interface and HTTP APIs, while offering a high-performance gRPC implementation that’s as fast as a native driver but with less network management configuration."
