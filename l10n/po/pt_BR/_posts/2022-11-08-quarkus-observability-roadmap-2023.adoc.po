msgid "https://quarkus.io[Quarkus] has come a long way in the _observability_ space. Initial support for Tracing and Metrics came from MicroProfile and their respective implementations, https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-opentracing/[SmallRye OpenTracing] and https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-metrics/[SmallRye Metrics]. Because the observability space evolved, these implementations expanded beyond the original specifications, and the Quarkus extensions providing Tracing and Metrics have been heavily used."

It was true for both https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-opentracing/[SmallRye OpenTracing] and https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-metrics/[SmallRye Metrics], but we now believe there are better alternatives to pursue in the upcoming Quarkus versions."

The initial support was only for HTTP Tracing (Vert.x and REST) but expanded to cover other components, including CDI, gRPC, Reactive Messaging, and many more, while also adopting and adjusting to all the new APIs released by OpenTelemetry Tracing. Our goal is to continue this work, expand OpenTelemetry Tracing to the remaining components and close the integration gaps between Quarkus and Tracing."

It also didn't help that users from different technologies had to learn new APIs and constructs to extract metrics information from their applications. We made a move to adopt https://micrometer.io[Micrometer] to resolve some of these issues while at the same time offering a less intrusive way to monitor Quarkus applications."

If needs are not sufficiently addressed and an industry initiative is open to collaboration, Quarkus proposes working within those initiatives to address MicroProfile needs and not having MicroProfile appear to compete with them by creating another specification. The current MicroProfile Metrics proposal is for consumers to use specific MicroProfile Metrics annotations and APIs, and it is up to the implementations to provide the support for them. We believe that a better approach is to follow OpenTelemetry Metrics and Micrometer initiatives, which are already well established and cover a comprehensive set of system components, including cloud providers, applications, and tooling."
