msgid "A fresh new year is a perfect time for some fresh new articles in the Quarkus Newsletter. \"Fine-grained authorization for Quarkus microservices\" by Raffaele Spazzoli is a great article describing a solution we call fine-grained authorization and uses Quarkus to implement Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) in the manner of Google Zanzibar. William Siqueiria, of the KIE team, announces the release of the \"Dashbuilder Quarkus\" extension where you can render dashboards directly in your Quarkus app. Markus Paulo has a great article (in Portuguese) on how to create a simple application using Quarkus and publish it on the Fly.io service. Kenneth Kogi has a cool guide taking you through building microservices with Quarkus. Check out Vadym Kazulkin's latest installment of his series \"Measuring Java 11 Lambda cold starts with SnapStart - Part 3 Using Quarkus Framework\" and learn to measure the performance of SnapStart using Quarkus."
