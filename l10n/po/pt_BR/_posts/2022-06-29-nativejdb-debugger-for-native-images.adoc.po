Debugging natively compiled code is not an easy task. It can be very different from the original Java source code due to extensive code optimizations, as well as differences in libraries used in native vs non-natively compiled code. In some cases, it is necessary to view both the source and the assembly code in order to gain better understanding of the program, further complicating the debugging task. "

msgid "https://github.com/nativejdb/[NativeJDB] is an *open-source* tool that supports *remote debugging* of a natively compiled Java code. In principle, this allows debugging from any IDE that supports the Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA), such as IntelliJ, Eclipse or VSCode. Attaching remotely means that the user can start a debugging session on *any O/S*, while the NativeJDB process itself runs in a Linux container. Our challenge is to bridge the gap between JPDA and the GDB, two stacks that don't typically talk to each other! To achieve this we essentially teach the GDB to speak the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP), used by IDEs to communicate with Java debuggers."

NativeJDB is useful when the observed behavior of the native executable is different than when the program is executed on a JVM. It can be used to explore optimizations and differences in libraries that account for behavioral anomalies. NativeJDB is not specific to Quarkus and can be used to debug any natively compiled Java code."

NativeJDB is used in a similar way: once it is started, the user attaches to it using a Remote Debug configuration from the IDE."

msgid "The IDE then communicates with NativeJDB using the JDWP. After the initial handshake and pleasantries (like capabilities and set of available classes), the protocol allows a user to manipulate the IDE's interface, which triggers appropriate JDWP packets to be sent to NativeJDB. These packets are interpreted by NativeJDB and translated to https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gdb/html_chapter/gdb_22.html[GDB-MI] commands. We use the MI interface to communicate with the GDB since it's the recommended interface to build tools on top of the GDB. The GDB then responds to these commands, and the responses are translated back into JDWP packets and sent back to the IDE."

In principle, NativeJDB can be used with any IDE that has a JDWP implementation, but it has mostly been tested and works with IntelliJ.
