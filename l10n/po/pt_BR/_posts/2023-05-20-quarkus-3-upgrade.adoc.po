msgid "Nevertheless, there is also some tedious work that needs to be done.  Quarkus 3 has updated to the latest Jakarta EE 10 APIs, which include the infamous change of the `javax.\\*` to the `jakarta.*` packages.  If your application makes use of any Jakarta API, and there's a good chance it does (think about JAX-RS, CDI, JPA, etc.), you'll need to modify your code.  Furthermore, if there's an explicit Jakarta API dependency in the project, you'll need to update this dependency as well."

The update process can be triggered from the Quarkus CLI, and directly via Maven or Gradle commands.  The tool itself is basically a set of https://docs.openrewrite.org/[OpenRewrite transformation rules].  Most of the rules are defined in the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-updates[Quarkus Update Recipes] project."
