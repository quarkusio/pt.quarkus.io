msgid "The DSN/DEV  is in charge of developing and maintaining various apps and specific tools. The IT department is as vast as the APHP itself. Dealing with every single medical specialty, it is sometimes difficult to find every needed tool on the market. That’s where the DSN/DEV intervene, creating ultra specialized micro apps.  With all these heterogeneous apps, the APHP faces multiple challenges in terms of communication. Once again it is the DSN/DEV job to ensure that every single part is able to communicate properly with each other, regardless of their nature and function. In doing so their job naturally requires mastery over the data stream and the ability to manipulate it in real time."

msgid "For that last part, our choices leaned toward WildFly/JBoss. We chose to package our applications in a single deliverable containing front end and back end due to the small size and to facilitate deployment. Our front end is rarely evolving, or to be more exact it evolves only when the back end is doing so. This allows our teams to quickly deploy new features. The size of our Information Network (hundreds of major apps and thousands of working instances) makes it so its global evolution is slow paced."

msgid "Using containers made us revise our choices. A key point in our decision was to keep working with technologies already mastered by our teams, and thus ensuring that any deployment or development of an app wouldn’t imply a total start from scratch, but rather the use of pre-existing mods. We wanted an evolution and not a revolution."

msgid "To manage the data stream between our apps, a stream supervisor tool was created, long before we chose to work with Java EE. This tool was based on the servlet specification, and over its 10 years of existence a heavy stratification took place. As it’s still performing properly, this app was chosen as our Quarkus test subject. We could try to develop a replacement and if we encountered any unexpected obstacle we could go back to the existing app."
