Sascha Moellering's \"How to deploy your Quarkus application to Amazon EK\" will show you how the Quarkus stack and additional extensions can be used to easily develop applications, compile them natively with GraalVM, package them in container images, and deploy them to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. Get an overview of the data streaming platform DataCater, discusses how we moved from Scala Play! and Kafka Streams to Quarkus, and presents why we think that Quarkus is an exceptional framework for developing cloud-native Java applications with Stefan Sprenger's article \"DataCater uses Quarkus to make Data Streaming more accessible\". Piotr Minkowski will show you how to build advanced testing scenarios with Quarkus in \"Advanced Testing with Quarkus\"."
