Read about making web applications more resilient against certain types of fraud with Erik Costlow's \"Quarkus Defends REST APIs against Attack\" article. Watch a cool video to see how Adam Bien took his Java 6 / Java EE 6 sample / GlassFish application created live at the JDD 2012 conference (Java EE: Future Is Now, But It Is Not Evenly Distributed Yet) and migrated it to MicroProfile and deployed as AWS Lambda. See how Alberto Bonacina experimented with the Quarkus framework to solve a problem he had with saving articles to read them later from different PCs and smartphone. See how Stephen Mimmo switched to use Podman instead of Docker for spinning up Testcontainers on MacOS. Read Ivan Senic's great article to learn the decision-making process behind why Stargate for Apache Cassandra chose Quarkus over Spring Boot and Micronaut as their chosen Java framework."
