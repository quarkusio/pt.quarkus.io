The main reason why we were not able to include Java 21 in our CI before is that part of our build is using Gradle (typically to build the Gradle plugin)  and Gradle doesn't fully support Java 21 yet.  To overcome this situation, we have decoupled the JVM used to build the Gradle bits from the JVM used to build Quarkus and run our tests, so we won't have this problem in the future anymore."
