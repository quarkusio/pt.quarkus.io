msgid "Since the creation of Quarkus (3 years ago), link:#existing-articles[many blog articles] have popped up to help in that matter, most of them taking advantage of the frontend-maven-plugin. As the creator of code.quarkus.io, I have also been confronted with this situation and I, like many others, have filled the gap using this plugin. It does the job for sure and has been good enough to fill the need for the time being. Unfortunately the overall process could be more streamlined and easier to get started with, it involves a lot of configuration, some tricky setup to copy the resources to the right place and test the frontend at the right moment. Live coding requires starting two processes and a proxy to make it work together."
