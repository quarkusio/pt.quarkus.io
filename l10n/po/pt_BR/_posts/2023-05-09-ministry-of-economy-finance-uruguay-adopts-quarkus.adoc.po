To ensure long-term viability and modernization, an architecture update is needed. The main objective is to establish a scalable reference architecture that enables SIIF to evolve as part of the modernization process.  In late 2021 an architecture team was formed, and work began following the https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf92-doc/arch/[TOGAF Architecture Development Method 9.2]."

As of today, the new base architecture is already defined, and SIIF started its migration. At least 5 more years of work with it and other internal systems is expected. Undoubtedly, we will continue working and improving this architecture for the years to come, aligned with the Quarkus ecosystem. We extend our gratitude to the entire Quarkus team and the enthusiastic community behind the project, of which we are proud to be a part."
