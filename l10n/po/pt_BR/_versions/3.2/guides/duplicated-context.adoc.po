msgid "When using a traditional, blocking, and synchronous framework, processing of each request is performed in a dedicated thread.  So, the same thread is used for the entire processing.  You know that this thread will not be used to execute anything else until the completion of the processing.  When you need to propagate data along the processing, such as the security principal or a trace id, you can use `ThreadLocals`.  The propagated data is cleared once the processing is complete."

msgid "When using a reactive and asynchronous execution model, you cannot use the same mechanism.  To avoid using many process threads, and reduce resource usage (and also increase the concurrency of the application), the same thread can be used to handle multiple concurrent processing.
