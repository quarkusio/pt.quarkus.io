However, according to the specification the `get()` method must identify the matching bean and obtain a contextual reference.  As a consequence, a new instance of a `@Dependent` bean is returned from each invocation of `get()`.  Moreover, this instance is a dependent object of the injected `Instance`.  This behavior is well-defined, but it may lead to unexpected errors and memory leaks.  Therefore, Quarkus comes with the `io.quarkus.arc.WithCaching` annotation.  An injected `Instance` annotated with this annotation will cache the result of the `Instance#get()` operation.  The result is computed on the first call and the same value is returned for all subsequent calls, even for `@Dependent` beans."
