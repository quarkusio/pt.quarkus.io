"The `quarkus-keycloak-authorization` extension is based on `quarkus-oidc` and provides a policy enforcer that enforces access to protected resources based on permissions managed by Keycloak and currently can only be used with the Quarkus xref:security-openid-connect.adoc[OIDC service applications].\n"
"It provides a flexible and dynamic authorization capability based on Resource-Based Access Control.\n"
