This strategy guarantees at-least-once delivery even if the channel performs asynchronous processing.  The connector tracks the received records and periodically (period specified by `auto.commit.interval.ms`, default: 5000 ms) commits the highest consecutive offset.  The connector will be marked as unhealthy if a message associated with a record is not acknowledged in `throttled.unprocessed-record-max-age.ms` (default: 60000 ms).  Indeed, this strategy cannot commit the offset as soon as a single record processing fails (see <<error-handling>> to configure what happens on failing processing).  If `throttled.unprocessed-record-max-age.ms` is set to less than or equal to `0`, it does not perform any health check verification.  Such a setting might lead to running out of memory if there are \"poison pill\" messages (that are never acked).  This strategy is the default if `enable.auto.commit` is not explicitly set to true."
